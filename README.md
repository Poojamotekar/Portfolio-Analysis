# Project Overview üìã
In this practical tech assignment, we are provided with a portfolio of 5 investment assets, and our goal is to apply our Python knowledge to review and assess the investment portfolio.

# Tasks ‚úèÔ∏è
## Exercise 1: Data Loading and Price Charting
Import the three available datasets: asset_price, asset_information, and portfolio_weights
Visualize the portfolio‚Äôs assets with a time series graph.

## Exercise 2: Daily Percentage Returns
Calculate asset‚Äôs daily percentage returns.
Calculate the correlation matrix for the five assets.
Create a scatter plot comparing the returns of two specific assets.

## Exercise 3: Portfolio Analysis
Create an area chart of the asset weights.
Plot the historical cumulative returns of the portfolio.
Calculate the annualized return of the portfolio.
Determine the annualized volatility of the portfolio (using an annualization factor of 261 days).
Produce an area chart grouping asset weights by their categories, as detailed in the asset_information_data.csv.

# Conclusions üí°
1)There is a significant price drop in almost all assets in 2020 (Feb-May)
2)Asset 1  & Asset 3 have the highest correlation Asset 2 & Asset 3 have highest correlation.
3)During the drop in 2020 Fixed income (mainly Asset 1)and Alternative assets (Asset 5) have the most asset weights.
4)Portfolio annual return is 0.12 which indicates that the portfolio has experienced growth in value over the years.
4)Portfolio anuual volatility is 0.085 which indicates the level of risk associated with the portfolio's returns over a one-year period.
